# CS162 Labs
This repository contains some of my Java lab exercises from CS162 in second semester of my first year in college. All the exercises were completed by me and sometimes the help of the demonstrators in the lab sessions. I also used online websites to help me understand some of the topics better and help me with the exercises, mainly [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Below is a list of all the labs and exercises in this repository along with a short description of each exercise:

# Lab 1
- [WeatherReport](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/WeatherReport.java): A Java program, called WeatherReport, which gets the user to input a single integer value between 0 and 45 degrees Celsius and print a message about todayâ€™s weather.

- [StarTriangle](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/StarTriangle.java): A Java program that prints to the screen rows of asterisk characters that form the shape of a triangle. Amount of rows is determined by user input.

- [GetSizes](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/GetSizes.java): A Java program that accepts 2 doubles as inputted by the user and prints out which number is the smallest and which is the largest.

- [OddEven](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/OddEven.java): A Java program that prompts the user to enter a single non-negative integer value and prints out to the screen if the number is odd or even.

- [MinNumber](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/MinNumber.java): A Java program that accepts 3 integers as input and prints to the screen the smallest of the inputs.

- [Reverse](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/Reverse.java): A Java program that prompts the user to enter a String and then prints the string out in reverse.

- [Prime](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/Prime.java): A Java program that prompts the user to enter two integers and prints out all prime numbers between the two integers inputted by the user.

# Lab 2
- [Factorial](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Factorial.java): A Java program that prompts the user to enter two integers, n & m, and prints out the factorial of all numbers from n up to m.

- [MethodArrays](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/MethodsArrays.java): A Java program that prompts the user to enter the size of an array and all of its elements. The program then prints to the screen the sum of all the elements in the array, and the average of all the elements in the array followed by the array elements printed to the screen separated by a space.

- [LinearSearch](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/LinearSearch.java): A Java program that checks for the occurance of a double entered by the user in an array and prints out a message if that lets the user know if the element was found or not.

- [SearchArray](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/SearchArray.java): A Java program that searches for the amount of times an inputted string is contained within a 2D array and prints out the answer.

# Lab 3
- [StringAcc](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/StringAcc.java): A Java program that checks if a String only contains 0s and 1s.

- [WhichExp](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/WhichExp.java): A Java program that checks if a program only contains the letters a and b.

- [ValidAge](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/ValidAge.java): A Java program that requests a user to input their age and verifies that the value the user enters is considered valid, lying in the range between 0 and 150.

- [ValidName](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/ValidName.java): a Java program that requests a user to input their first name. The program should verify that the user enters a reasonable first name. A name that begins with a capital letter, is between 2 and 25 characters in length and doesn't contain any special characters.

- [FlightCode](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/FlightCode.java): A Java program that requests a user to enter a flight code. The program verifies that the user entered a valid flight code. A valid flight code begins with 2 or 3 capital letters and is followed by 3 or 4 digits.

- [Genomes](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/Genomes.java): A Java program that checks if a String entered by the user contains genome characters (c, g, a, t)

- [Alarm](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/Alarm.java): A Java program that prompts the user to enter a password to deactivate an alarm. If the String taken as a parameter contains the sequence "1234" anywhere in the input; thus "1234" is the password. Program reject any other sequence and any sequence greater than 10 characters. Failure to enter the correct password results in printing "Alarm Activated" to the screen.

- [Password](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/Password.java): A Java program that checks the strength of a user inputted password by giving it a score between 0 - 10 and rating it as weak, fair, good or strong.
