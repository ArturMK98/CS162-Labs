# CS162 Labs
This repository contains some of my Java lab exercises from CS162 in second semester of my first year in college. All the exercises were completed by me and sometimes the help of the demonstrators in the lab sessions. I also used online websites to help me understand some of the topics better and help me with the exercises, mainly [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Below is a list of all the labs and exercises in this repository along with a short description of each exercise:

# Lab 1
- [WeatherReport](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/WeatherReport.java): A Java program, called WeatherReport, which gets the user to input a single integer value between 0 and 45 degrees Celsius and print a message about todayâ€™s weather.

If the String taken as a parameter contains the sequence "1234" anywhere in the input; thus "1234" is the password. Program reject any other sequence and any sequence greater than 10 characters. Failure to enter the correct password results in printing "Alarm Activated" to the screen.

- [StringClean](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%204/StringClean.java): A Java program that cleans up a String using recursion. A "cleaned" String is one where only adjacent chars that are the same have been reduced to a single char. So "yyzzza" yields "yza".

- [CountDigits](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS162-Labs/blob/master/Lab%204/CountDigits.java): A Java program that counts the number of occurrences of 8 as a digit using recursion, except that an 8 with another 8 immediately to its left counts double, so 8818 yields 4.
